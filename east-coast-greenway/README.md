- states.geojson, which is just simplified state outlines that I downloaded from https://eric.clst.org/tech/usgeojson/
- county-pop-density/county-pop-density-final.geojson, which contains counties in states that are passed by the East Coast Greenway, with calculated population density.
I calculated population density using US Census TIGER land area for counties, and ACS 2018 5-year population estimates, and rounded it to the nearest integer.
I mapped it and it makes sense. I spot-checked several counties with Wikipedia data, and it matches (+/- a few people per mi2).
